# MERN_Full_Stack_Medicare_CSE499
Here, I used MongoDB, Express JS, React JS , Node JS to develop a web application for Medicare. I used REDUX as state management tool with react framework because REDUX tool helped me to understand and catch where,when,why and how my application state changed.This project is for my final year project course CSE499.
Here, I mainly learned how we can run backend and frontend framework(REACT) concurrently. I also learned how REDUX works. In this project, I learned and got to know about many dependencies like npm i axios, react-router-dom, redux , react-thunk, redux-devtools-extension, react-moment and many more. These dependencies and modules helped to connect backend with the frontend react framework. 
At first, I did only backend works for the web development using express JS, node js and mongoDB. Then I checked and run those api using postman.com. I used 'npm run server' in the terminal of vs code to run only backend.
Then, I concurrently run the backend or server side with the client side or front end, using 'npm run dev' . Then I used redux to check everything like invalid credentials,login and registration json token etc. 
Mainly, I learned how react works, how backend can be connected with react, how to use redux, how api works using postman, how mongoDB database works, how to use get , post, put,delete using express, node, postman, MongoDB.
