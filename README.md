# MERN_Full_Stack_Medicare_CSE499
Here, I used MongoDB, Express JS, React JS , Node JS to develop a web application for Medicare. I used redux as state management tool with react framework because REDUX tool helped me to understand and catch where,when,why and how my application state changed.This project is for my final year project course CSE499.
